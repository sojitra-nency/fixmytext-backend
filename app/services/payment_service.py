    """Verify a Razorpay payment end-to-end.

    Performs three checks in order:
    1. Cryptographic signature validation against Razorpay's secret.
    2. Fetches the order from Razorpay to read its metadata.
    3. Confirms the order belongs to the authenticated user by comparing
       ``user.id`` (from the JWT) — NOT from ``order.notes``, which could
       be tampered with if the order-creation payload were replayed.

    Args:
        razorpay_order_id: The Razorpay order ID from the client callback.
        razorpay_payment_id: The Razorpay payment ID from the client callback.
        razorpay_signature: HMAC-SHA256 signature from Razorpay.
        user: The currently authenticated user (from ``Depends(get_current_user)``).

    Returns:
        The full Razorpay order dict on success.

    Raises:
        HTTPException(400): Invalid signature or order does not belong to user.
        HTTPException(502): Razorpay API is unreachable.
